Final pricing depends on the number of target keywords, languages and markets; you get a fixed monthly figure before work begins." },
    { question: "How long does SEO take to show results?", answer: "Technical fixes and on-page improvements often move rankings within 4–8 weeks. Competitive commercial keywords typically take 4–6 months of consistent content and link building. Local SEO and citation work usually shows movement in the map pack within 30–60 days." },
    { question: "Do you guarantee first-page rankings?", answer: "No credible agency can guarantee a specific position, because ranking systems are controlled by Google and AI engines. We guarantee deliverables, timelines and transparent reporting, and we track ranking, traffic and conversion trends so progress is measurable." },
    { question: "Which countries do you provide SEO services in?", answer: "We serve clients globally, with focus markets in the United States, United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates and Europe, plus national coverage across India including Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Visakhapatnam." },
    { question: "Is your link building safe?", answer: "Yes. All links and citations are placed manually on real, indexed sites with genuine traffic. We do not use private blog networks, automated tools or link farms, which is why our clients avoid manual actions and algorithmic penalties." },
    { question: "Do you work with small businesses and startups?", answer: "Yes. A large part of our client base is small businesses, local service providers and early-stage startups. Local SEO from $100 per month is designed specifically for businesses that need enquiries rather than vanity traffic." },
    { question: "What reporting do you provide?", answer: "You receive a monthly report covering keyword rankings, organic sessions, conversions, links and citations built, technical health and AI-answer visibility, along with a short written summary of what changed and what happens next." },
    { question: "Can you fix an existing site or do you need to rebuild it?", answer: "In most cases we optimise the existing site. Rebuilds are only recommended when the platform blocks indexation, speed or schema — and we will tell you plainly if that is the case rather than selling a redesign by default." },
    { question: "Do your SEO packages include content writing?", answer: "Yes. Content briefs and answer-first article production are included in all standard retainers. Volume depends on the package; additional articles and landing pages can be added at any time." },
    { question: "How is SEO different from AI SEO?", answer: "Classic SEO optimises for ranked links in Google and Bing. AI SEO — AEO, GEO, LLM SEO and LLMO — optimises for being quoted inside AI answers from ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Copilot and Google AI Overviews. We run both together because users now move between them." },

    { question: "Do I need separate websites for each country?", answer: "Usually not. For most businesses a single domain with country subdirectories and correct hreflang performs better than several weak websites, because all links and authority accumulate on one domain." },
    { question: "How does hreflang work?", answer: "Hreflang tags tell search engines which language and regional version of a page to show. Each version must reference every other version, including itself, and pair with a self-referencing canonical. Incorrect or one-way hreflang is one of the most common international SEO faults we fix." },
    { question: "How long does global SEO take?", answer: "Architecture and technical work is typically complete in 3–6 weeks. Ranking traction in a new country usually appears from month three, and compounds from month six as market-specific links and content accumulate." },
    { question: "Can you handle non-English markets?", answer: "Yes. We manage localisation with native reviewers for major European languages and Arabic, and we always localise intent and examples rather than machine-translating existing pages." },
    { question: "How much does global SEO cost?", answer: "Global SEO retainers start at $200 per month for a single market and scale with the number of countries, languages and pages. You receive a fixed monthly price after the audit, with no long lock-in contracts." },
    { question: "Will duplicate English pages hurt my rankings?", answer: "Not if handled correctly. Near-duplicate US, UK and AU pages need hreflang plus meaningful localisation — pricing, spelling, examples and contact details — so each version is genuinely useful for its market." },
    { question: "Do you build links in each target country?", answer: "Yes. Local relevance matters, so we place manual guest posts, listings and digital PR mentions on sites based in or read by each target market rather than relying on generic global directories." },
    { question: "How do you measure global SEO performance?", answer: "We segment Search Console and analytics by country, then report impressions, clicks, average position, conversions and AI-answer citations per market so you can see which country is paying back its investment." },
    { question: "Can global SEO work for a small business?", answer: "Yes, if you focus. We usually start with one or two priority countries and a tight keyword set rather than launching ten locales at once, which keeps costs low and produces measurable wins faster." },

  faqs: [
    { question: "How long does a technical SEO audit take?", answer: "A standard audit is delivered within five working days. Enterprise sites with log-file analysis and multiple templates take up to ten working days." },
    { question: "Do you implement fixes or only recommend them?", answer: "Both. Many clients hand the prioritised backlog to their own developers; others ask us to implement directly. We are comfortable working in WordPress, Shopify and custom stacks." },
    { question: "What are Core Web Vitals and do they still matter?", answer: "Core Web Vitals measure loading (LCP), responsiveness (INP) and visual stability (CLS). They are a real but modest ranking factor, and a large conversion factor — slow mobile pages lose revenue regardless of rankings." },
    { question: "Will technical SEO alone increase my traffic?", answer: "Technical SEO removes constraints; content and authority create growth. When a site has serious crawl, index or rendering issues, fixing them can produce immediate gains. On a technically healthy site, the returns come from content and links instead." },
    { question: "How do you handle JavaScript-heavy websites?", answer: "We test rendered versus raw HTML, identify content that only appears after hydration, and recommend server-side rendering, static generation or prerendering for critical pages so both Google and AI crawlers see complete content." },
    { question: "What schema markup should my site have?", answer: "At minimum Organization and WebSite sitewide, Service on service pages, Article on posts, FAQPage where you answer questions, LocalBusiness for physical locations and BreadcrumbList on deep pages. We map schema per template rather than page by page." },
    { question: "How often should a technical audit be repeated?", answer: "A full audit annually, with quarterly health checks. Any time you migrate platforms, redesign or change URL structure, run an audit before and after launch." },
    { question: "Can technical SEO recover a traffic drop?", answer: "Often yes, when the drop came from an accidental noindex, a broken migration, canonical errors or a server performance regression. We start by matching the drop date against deployments, Search Console coverage and algorithm updates." },
    { question: "Do you do site migrations?", answer: "Yes. We plan URL mapping, redirect rules, schema parity and staging QA, then monitor coverage and rankings daily for the first four weeks after launch." },
    { question: "Does technical SEO affect AI visibility?", answer: "Significantly. Most AI crawlers do not render JavaScript and rely heavily on structured data and clean semantics, so a technically sound site is a precondition for being cited in AI answers." },

      ],
    },
  ],
  faqs: [
    { question: "What is GEO targeting in SEO?", answer: "GEO targeting is optimising pages for searches that include a location, such as 'SEO services Hyderabad'. It combines city-specific content, geographic schema and locally relevant links so the page ranks in and for that place." },
    { question: "How is GEO targeting different from local SEO?", answer: "Local SEO focuses on map pack visibility around a physical location and relies heavily on Google Business Profile. GEO targeting is about organic pages ranking for location keywords, which works even in cities where you have no office." },
    { question: "Can I rank in a city where I have no office?", answer: "Yes, in organic results. You can build a service-area page for that city with genuine local content and links. You cannot legitimately appear in the map pack there without a verified address in that city." },
    { question: "How many city pages should I create?", answer: "Only as many as you can make genuinely different and genuinely serve. Ten strong city pages outperform a hundred templated ones, which risk being classified as doorway pages." },
    { question: "Do city pages count as doorway pages?", answer: "They do if they offer no unique value. Pages with distinct copy, real local proof, unique FAQs and clear service information are legitimate and rank well." },
    { question: "How long do city pages take to rank?", answer: "Tier-2 city pages often rank within 6–10 weeks. Tier-1 metros with entrenched competitors typically need four to six months of supporting links and content." },
    { question: "Do you handle regional languages?", answer: "We handle English plus transliterated regional terms that people actually search, and can arrange native-language content for Hindi, Telugu and Tamil where the demand justifies it." },
    { question: "What schema do city pages need?", answer: "Service or LocalBusiness schema with areaServed and geo coordinates, plus BreadcrumbList and FAQPage. This combination is also what AI engines use when answering location-based questions." },
    { question: "Can GEO targeting work internationally?", answer: "Yes. The same approach applies to Dubai, London or New York, with the addition of hreflang and currency localisation when multiple countries are in play." },
    { question: "How do you measure GEO targeting success?", answer: "We track rankings by city keyword group, organic sessions and conversions filtered by landing page, and grid-based local rank where a Google Business Profile exists in that city." },

  ],
  faqs: [
    { question: "How many citations does my business need?", answer: "Most single-location businesses need 30–60 quality citations. Beyond that, accuracy matters far more than volume — one conflicting listing can do more damage than ten extra directories add value." },
    { question: "How fast are citations delivered?", answer: "Standard packages of 30 manual citations are delivered within three working days, with a report of live URLs and login details for each submission." },
    { question: "Are the citations manual or automated?", answer: "Every citation is created manually by a team member. We do not use automated submission tools, which frequently produce broken or duplicate listings that later require cleanup." },

    { question: "Do citations help if I have no physical storefront?", answer: "Yes. Service-area businesses still benefit from consistent listings; we simply hide the street address where the directory allows and emphasise the service radius." },
    { question: "Can you fix a suspended Google Business Profile?", answer: "We can prepare and submit a reinstatement request with supporting documentation, and correct the underlying issue — most often address mismatch, keyword stuffing in the name or ineligible virtual offices." },
    { question: "Do you manage multi-location businesses?", answer: "Yes. We manage bulk uploads, per-location profiles, location-specific posts and reporting, with 30 citations per location as standard." },
    { question: "Will citations alone put me in the map pack?", answer: "Citations remove a barrier rather than guarantee a position. Combined with a fully optimised profile, review velocity, local content and proximity, they are one of the fastest levers available." },
    { question: "Do AI assistants use citation data?", answer: "Yes. Assistants frequently synthesise directory and review data when answering local questions, so consistent citations improve the odds of being named in an AI recommendation." },
